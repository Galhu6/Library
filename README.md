# Personal Modular Library

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a modular, well-structured, and reusable personal library that will serve as the foundation for creating full applications and projects with **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and **advanced OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming) design.

This library is intended to streamline development, reduce boilerplate, and provide clean, extendable components that I can reuse across multiple projects.

## ðŸ’¡ Planned Features

- Ready-to-use classes and utilities (task managers, schedulers, logic helpers, etc.)
- Easy-to-extend and plug-and-play components
- Fully tested units with Jest
- Auto-generated documentation via TypeDoc
- Clean and intuitive documentation structure

This is the beginning of a growing personal toolkit â€“ a library of powerful components that will accelerate future development and serve as a core for more complex systems.
